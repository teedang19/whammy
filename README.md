This page is a reflection about working on this challenge. [Click here for API Documentation.](https://github.com/teedang19/whammy/wiki)

This challenge was super fun. I have never built a command line app before. Major thank you to [practicing ruby](https://practicingruby.com/articles/building-unix-style-command-line-applications) for showing me the way! I am always grateful to those who teach, lead, and share passionately, and I hope I am one of those people.

I am proud of this codebase. I can say with relative confidence that it does what is asked; is 100% tested; and is well-organized and readable to the best of my ability. I also have never used [grape](https://github.com/intridea/grape). I put a lot of work and thought into this, and I am counting it as a personal success. Huzzah!

####Questions I had/Things that gave me trouble:
**TDD: Panic and Tears**   

**Models without Rails**   

**I don't know what 'parse' means**
